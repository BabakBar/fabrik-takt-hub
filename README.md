## What is FabrikTakt?

FabrikTakt is like having a smart assistant on the factory floor. I'm building technology that helps small and medium manufacturers capture knowledge, solve problems faster, and make better decisions - all through simple, conversational interfaces.

Think of it as the "Factory Brain" üß† that:

- Remembers solutions to problems so we don't have to solve them twice
- Helps operators get quick answers to their questions
- Keeps track of what's happening across our production
- Speaks our language (literally - we support multiple languages!)

## About This Repo

This repo contains the **frontend interface** for FabrikTakt - the part you see and interact with. It's built with modern web technologies to be fast, responsive, and easy to use on any device.

## The Story Behind FabrikTakt

I've been, seen and worked in manufacturing industries from my childhood because of our family business. Manufacturing is incredibly complex, but the tools available to most small and medium manufacturers are either too simple or overwhelmingly complicated. Now it's time to build something different - technology that's powerful enough to make a real difference, but simple enough that anyone can use it.

My goal is to help every manufacturing team capture their hard-earned knowledge, solve problems more efficiently, and ultimately build better products.
